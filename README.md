# SpotifyClone

Spotify is an audio streaming and media services provider. We implemented a clone of it 
in our Software Engineering Course project [2021-2022] , adding new fun features like the ability of the artist to add concert tickets on sale.

# Developed using
1. C#
2. Windows Forms 
3. Oracle Database (with some features operating on connected mode and other features on disconnected mode)
4. Crystal Reports
